# CIFAR-10 Dataset:
- contains 60k color images - 10 classes, 6k images per class
- 50k train, 10k test images
- available in tensorflow.keras.datasets

# CNN:
- performs 2D convolutions (imagine Sobel edge detector, except the kernel matrix values are the weights)
- discovers interesting patterns in images
- earlier layers learn basic patterns (lines, borders); later layers learn more complex patterns (legs, hands)
